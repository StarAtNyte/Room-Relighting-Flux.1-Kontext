## üìÅ Contents

### Timelapse Animations
- `Bathroom_Innorim_timelapse.gif` - Modern bathroom with natural lighting progression
- `Bedroom_Arcadu_timelapse.gif` - Cozy bedroom showing 17-hour lighting cycle
- `Bedroom_Aspilig_S2_timelapse.gif` - Contemporary bedroom with dramatic lighting changes

## üéØ What These Examples Demonstrate

### Lighting Progression
Each timelapse shows a complete 17-hour lighting cycle from 6 AM to 10 PM:
- **Morning (6-8 AM)**: Soft golden sunrise light with long shadows
- **Late Morning (9-11 AM)**: Bright natural daylight
- **Midday (12 PM)**: Intense overhead lighting with minimal shadows
- **Afternoon (1-5 PM)**: Warm afternoon light with changing shadow angles
- **Evening (6-8 PM)**: Golden hour with dramatic warm lighting
- **Night (9-10 PM)**: Interior artificial lighting with dark windows

### Technical Quality
- **Consistency**: Room structure and furniture remain unchanged
- **Realism**: Natural shadow progression and light behavior
- **Detail Preservation**: Fine details maintained across all lighting conditions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gradual lighting changes create believable time progression
